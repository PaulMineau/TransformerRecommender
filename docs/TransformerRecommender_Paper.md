## Abstract

We present a transformer-based sequential recommender trained and evaluated on the Amazon Beauty dataset. The model suite includes an enhanced transformer, a numerically stable transformer baseline, and an LSTM baseline. We report standard ranking metrics and observe state-of-the-art Hit Rate@10 for the enhanced transformer variant. We release training scripts, evaluation protocols, and a lightweight demo for reproducible benchmarking.

## 1. Introduction

Transformers have become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, including sequential recommendation. In this work we document the design and empirical behavior of the *TransformerRecommender* system, which provides next-item prediction over user purchase histories from the Amazon Product Data (Beauty subset).

## 2. Related Work

Self-attentive sequential recommenders such as SASRec adapt decoder-style transformers to model user-item sequences. Encoder-style approaches (e.g., BERT4Rec) provide masked modeling alternatives; we focus on the decoder-style formulation due to its simplicity and strong performance.

## 3. Dataset

We use the Amazon Product Data, specifically the Beauty category. Interactions are derived from user reviews/purchases, with item metadata available for analysis.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Source**: Amazon Product Data (Beauty category)
- **Total Users**: 22,363
- **Total Items**: 12,101
- **Interactions**: User purchase/review sequences
- **Preprocessing**: Minimum 5 interactions per user/item

## 4. Model

The enhanced transformer follows a standard decoder-stack with learned item embeddings, positional encodings, multi-head self-attention, and position-wise feed-forward layers. Training employs:

- **Numerical stabilization**: Gradient clipping and careful initialization
- **Beam-search decoding**: For improved top-K ranking
- **Multi-task learning**: Item + category prediction
- **Enhanced features**: User context embeddings, attention visualization

### Model Variants:

1. **Enhanced Transformer (50 epochs)**: State-of-the-art configuration
2. **Enhanced Transformer (quick)**: Faster training version
3. **Stable Transformer**: Numerically stable baseline
4. **Simple LSTM**: Traditional baseline for comparison

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

We compute industry-standard ranking metrics:

- **Hit Rate@K (HR@K)**: Counts users for which the ground-truth item appears within the top-K predictions
- **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K)**: Weights positions logarithmically
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Averages reciprocal ranks of ground-truth items

### Evaluation Protocol:

- **Leave-one-out**: Last item in sequence as target
- **All-items ranking**: Conservative evaluation against full catalog
- **Alternative protocols**: 99 random negatives for literature comparison

## 6. Results

### 6.1 Main Results
