\begin{abstract}
We present a transformer-based sequential recommender trained and evaluated on the Amazon Beauty dataset. The model suite includes an enhanced transformer, a numerically stable transformer baseline, and an LSTM baseline. We report standard ranking metrics and observe state-of-the-art Hit Rate@10 for the enhanced transformer variant. We release training scripts, evaluation protocols, and a lightweight demo for reproducible benchmarking.

\section{Introduction}
Transformers \cite{vaswani2017attention} have become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, including sequential recommendation \cite{kang2018sasrec}. In this work we document the design and empirical behavior of the \emph{TransformerRecommender} system, which provides next-item prediction over user purchase histories from the Amazon Product Data \cite{mcauley2015amazon} (Beauty subset).

\section{Related Work}
Self-attentive sequential recommenders such as SASRec \cite{kang2018sasrec} adapt decoder-style transformers to model user-item sequences. Encoder-style approaches (e.g., BERT4Rec) provide masked modeling alternatives; we focus on the decoder-style formulation due to its simplicity and strong performance.

\section{Dataset}
We use the Amazon Product Data \cite{mcauley2015amazon}, specifically the Beauty category. Interactions are derived from user reviews/purchases, with item metadata available for analysis.

\section{Model}
The enhanced transformer follows a standard decoder-stack with learned item embeddings, positional encodings, multi-head self-attention, and position-wise feed-forward layers. Training employs numerical stabilization (e.g., gradient clipping and careful initialization), beam-search decoding for improved top-$K$ ranking, and multi-task learning (item + category prediction), as implemented in the repository.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}
We compute industry-standard ranking metrics: Hit Rate@K (HR@K), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K), and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) \cite{metrics2022}. HR@K counts users for which the ground-truth item appears within the top-$K$ predictions. NDCG@K weights positions logarithmically, and MRR averages reciprocal ranks of ground-truth items.

\section{Results}
Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes Hit Rate@10 extracted from the repository's training scripts and README. Figure~\ref{fig:hr10} visualizes comparative results.

\section{Reproducibility}
The repository provides scripts to train and evaluate variants: \texttt{train\_50\_epochs.py} (SOTA performance), \texttt{train\_enhanced\_transformer.py} (quick), \texttt{train\_stable\_transformer.py} (baseline), and \texttt{train\_simple.py} (LSTM). Metrics computation uses standard protocols and excludes items already observed in a user's history from candidate sets.

\section{Conclusion}
The enhanced transformer delivers the best HR@10 among tested baselines on Amazon Beauty. Future work includes adding full NDCG and MRR reporting, ablations on beam size and loss functions, and broader category generalization.
