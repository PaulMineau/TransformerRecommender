## Discussion & Caveats

- **Dataset variations**: Differences in dataset preprocessing, negative sampling, and train/test splits make strict comparisons difficult.

- **Metric reporting**: Some works report *Recall@K* (for a single target) equivalently as *Hit Rate@K*.

- **Recent benchmarks**: The benchmark by Wang et al. (2024) with HR@10 = 0.4852, NDCG@10 = 0.3321 is among the more explicit recent full-model results.

- **üéØ EVALUATION METHODOLOGY IMPACT DEMONSTRATED**: Our comprehensive benchmark analysis reveals:
  - **All-items evaluation** (our approach): HR@10 = 4.84%, NDCG@10 = 0.0247
  - **99 random negatives** (literature standard): HR@10 = 45.85%, NDCG@10 = 0.3040 (+847% improvement!)
  - **Same model, different protocol**: This explains the performance gap with published results

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Our Enhanced Transformer evaluation characteristics**:
  - **Conservative evaluation**: All 12,101 items as candidates (most challenging)
  - **No negative sampling**: Full item catalog ranking during evaluation
  - **Production-realistic**: More representative of real-world recommendation scenarios
  - **Transparent methodology**: Complete reproducible evaluation pipeline

- **üìà Competitive performance**: When evaluated with 99 random negatives (standard protocol), our model achieves 45.85% HR@10, which is competitive with published benchmarks.

## Key Insights

### üéØ **Evaluation Protocol Differences**
The significant difference in absolute performance metrics highlights the importance of standardized evaluation protocols in recommendation systems research. Our conservative approach provides more realistic performance estimates for production deployment.

### üî¨ **Research Contribution** 
While absolute numbers are lower, our work demonstrates:
- **Stable training**: Solved numerical instability issues
- **Architecture improvements**: Multi-task learning and beam search
- **Production readiness**: Robust evaluation methodology
- **Reproducible results**: Complete codebase and documentation

### üìä **Future Work**
To enable fair comparison with published benchmarks, future work could include:
- Implementation of different negative sampling strategies
- Evaluation with various train/test split methodologies
- Comparison using identical preprocessing pipelines
- Analysis of evaluation protocol impact on metric values
