- **MRR**: Mean Reciprocal Rank - average of reciprocal ranks of relevant items

These are the standard metrics used in major e-commerce recommendation research and industry applications.

## 🗂️ Dataset

Uses the **Amazon Beauty dataset** - a widely recognized benchmark in recommendation systems:
- **Reviews**: User ratings and reviews for beauty products
- **Metadata**: Product information including titles, brands, categories, and prices
- **Scale**: Thousands of users and products with hundreds of thousands of interactions

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Transformer Model Components:
1. **Item Embedding Layer**: Converts product IDs to dense vectors
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds sequence position information
3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures item relationships and dependencies
4. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Processes attention outputs
5. **Output Projection**: Maps to product recommendation scores

### Key Features:
- **Sequence Modeling**: Handles variable-length purchase histories
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on relevant items in the sequence
- **Padding Support**: Efficiently processes batches of different lengths
- **Exclusion Logic**: Avoids recommending already purchased items

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Custom Dataset Support

To use your own dataset, modify `data_preprocessor.py`:

```python
# Your dataset should have columns: user_id, item_id, timestamp
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
preprocessor = RecommendationDataPreprocessor()
train_data, test_data = preprocessor.process_dataset(df)
```

### Model Customization

Extend the transformer model for specific needs:

```python
class CustomTransformerRecommender(TransformerRecommender):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Add custom layers
        self.user_embedding = nn.Embedding(n_users, d_model)
    
    def forward(self, x, user_ids=None):
        # Custom forward pass with user embeddings
        pass
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**: Reduce `batch_size` or `d_model`
2. **Slow Training**: Enable GPU or reduce `max_seq_len`
3. **Poor Performance**: Increase `min_interactions` or `epochs`
4. **App Not Loading**: Ensure model is trained first with `python train_model.py`

### Memory Requirements:
- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, CPU training
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, GPU with 4GB VRAM
- **Large Scale**: 16GB+ RAM, GPU with 8GB+ VRAM
